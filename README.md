# About üìù

**What is Fruitful Discussions?**

- Fruitful Discussions is a project I completed during the Northcoders bootcamp. Using databases seeded earlier in the course, I built an API for the purpose of accessing application data programatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service (such as Reddit) which should provide this information to the Front End architecture.

**How do I get access to the hosted version?**

- [The FruitFul-Discussions-BE](https://nc-news-project-t1h4.onrender.com/). However, this merely shows information in JSON format when a request is made to that endpoint. To see this data being used in the front end, take a look at [Fruitful-Discussions-FE (GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/loafdimension/fruitful-discussions-FE), and the [Hosted Fruitful-Discussions-FE]().

# Testing and Test Coverage

**Where can I find the tests and how do I run them?**

- The tests are located in the **tests** folder and were separated in to testing the utility functions, the seeding, and the app which handled any requests to the API.
- The principle of Test Driven Development (TDD) was followed throughout and the Jest framework was used, along with the Supertest library.
- To run all of the tests, you can run the command "npm run test", or "npm t" for short, followed by the file you wish to see. For example, "npm t app", "npm t seed", "npm t utils". Please see the scripts in the package JSON to see more options.
- To filter by test within each file, add .only or .skip to whichever tests you wish to filter.

|                File                 | Tests |
| :---------------------------------: | :---: |
|   [App](./__tests__//app.test.js)   |  39   |
|  [Seed](./__tests__//seed.test.js)  |  40   |
| [Utils](./__tests__//utils.test.js) |   7   |
|                Total                |  86   |

# How to Install and Run üöÄ

**1 - Ensure that you have the required versions of Node.js and Postgres**

Verify that you have compatible versions of Node.js and PostgreSQL installed. The project was developed with the following versions:

Node.js: v22.14.0
PostgreSQL: 17.4

**2 - Fork and clone the repository**

Git clone: https://github.com/loafdimension/seeding-nc-news.git

**3 - Install the required dependencies**

Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies from the packag.json.
`npm install`

**4 - Set up the Environment Variables**

In the root of the directory create 2 .env files:
`.env.test` and `.env.development`.

- In each of these files, write the environmental variable, "PGDATABASE" and set its value to the name of the database it should interact with.
- In this case, this means .env.test should be populated with "PGDATABASE=nc_news_test and .env.development should be populated with "PGDATABASE=nc_news"

**5 - Seed the local database**

Set up and seed your local PostgreSQL databases by running the following commands in this order:
1 - `npm run setup-dbs`
2 - Either `npm run seed-dev` (for development data), or `npm run seed-prod` (for production data)
